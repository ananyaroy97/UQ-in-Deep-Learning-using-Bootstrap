# UQ-in-Deep-Learning-using-Bootstrap
Research project on uncertainty quantification in deep learning, addressing overconfidence in neural networks. Compares Bayesian approaches such as Monte Carlo Dropout with bootstrap ensembles (standard, Bayesian, parametric). Simulation studies evaluate effects of dropout rates and noise on calibration, accuracy, and uncertainty estimation.
